## **3D Mesh Manager**

Python program that:

Lets you upload several mesh files(.obj) in specified path and stores its metadata 
(name, number of vertices, faces, file path, dimensions-bounding box, texture) in txt/csv.

It can directly visualize each mesh by saving rendered JPG in shaded and wireframe version.

Allows searching, listing, and exporting metadata (JSON/CSV) without need of opening mesh in 3D app.

Is OOP. Keeps this info in a class-based structure.

Unit tests included.

Use of external API - can download additional meshes/textures/image references.
